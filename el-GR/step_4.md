## Ending the activity

Awesome work so far! You now have an assistant that will help you or someone else get active.

The final thing to do is to add some code so the activity stops.

### When to stop?

\--- task ---

**Choose:** How you would like your activity to stop.

You can use **events** to stop the activity, such as a button press or gesture.

OR

You can use **selection**, such as an `if`{:class='microbitlogic'} statement in your **loop** to end your activity.

Decide which makes the most sense for your activity, and if you aren't sure which to use, then go for an event.

\--- /task ---

\--- task ---

Add the event or the `if`{:class='microbitlogic'} block to your project.

#### Events

[[[microbit-button-trigger]]]

[[[microbit-gesture-trigger]]]

#### if blocks

[[[microbit-selection]]]

\--- /task ---

### How to stop?

To stop, you have to change the `started`{:class='microbitvariables'} variable from `true`{:class='microbitlogic'} to `false`{:class='microbitlogic'}.

\--- task ---

Drag a `set`{:class='microbitvariables'} block from the Toolbox into your event or `if`{:class='microbitlogic'} block.

Get a `true`{:class='microbitlogic'} block and replace the `0` in the `set`{:class='microbitvariables'} block with it.

## title: Use the same event to start and end the activity

If you have used events for your assistant, you might not have many unused events left or a place to put an `if`{:class='microbitlogic'} block to end the activity.

That's not a problem â€” you can use the same event to begin and end the activity.

You just need to use an `if...else`{:class='microbitlogic'} block to control what the `started`{:class='microbitvariables'} variable is set to.

```microbit
let started = false
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    if (started == false) {
        started = true
    } else {
        started = false
    }
})
```

### End screen

The final step is to create an **end screen**. This might be the score or count you kept, or a inspirational message to make your user feel good about their activity.

\--- task ---

Add some code that uses the LEDs to create your end screen. Place it below the `set started to`{:class='microbitvariables'} `false`{:class='microbitlogic'} block.

[[[microbit-icons]]]

[[[microbit-animation]]]

[[[microbit-text]]]

\--- /task ---

### Test your assistant

\--- task ---

**Test** your program on the simulator, then download the program onto your physical micro:bit and test it out for real!

Make sure you are happy with:

- The start-up screen
- Starting the activity
- Completing the activity
- Ending the activity
- The end screen

\--- /task ---

\--- task ---

**Debug:**

Make sure to use `pause`{:class='microbitbasic'} blocks to space out your programs.

You can use `clear screen`{:class='microbitbasic'} blocks to clean up the **UI** and make it exactly like you want.

Make sure you set your `Variables`{:class='microbitvariables'} at the start to the values you want them to start with.
