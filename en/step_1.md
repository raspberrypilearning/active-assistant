### Hang time 

This assistant lets you improve your upper body strength by hanging from a low bar (no dangerous heights, please!) for a time you can set. 

+ **Download** the code to your micro:bit and run it on batteries.
+ The default hang time is 10 seconds.
+ Set a hang time goal: Press Button A to increase the time goal by one second and Button B to decrease it.
+ Put the micro:bit in your pocket and, when you are ready, shout "GO"!
+ The micro:bit will sense the loud sound and start a timer, beeping every second.
+ When you release from the bar, the micro:bit will sense a free fall event and show if you have met your hang time goal.
+ If your hang time was longer than the longest hang time since the micro:bit was powered on, you will also see a stick figure icon!
+ You can see the longest hang time by pressing Buttons A+B together. 
+ Click the micro:bit logo at the top to restart the simulator!
