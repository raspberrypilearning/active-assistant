## What next?

If you are following the [Introduction to micro:bit](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/microbit-intro) path, you can move on to the [Party game](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/party-game) project. In this project, you will make a version of your favourite party game to play with your friends and family.

### Musical chairs

In this project, the micro:bit is used to control a game of musical chairs.

The number of players is set to `4`, so line up `3` chairs to play the game!

- Watch the start-up animation of someone sitting on a chair.
- A flashing arrow points to the touch logo.
- When you touch the logo:
  - You are shown a 3,2,1 countdown, then a picture of an empty chair.
  - A melody plays for a random amount of time (between 3 and 15 seconds).
  - All players should move around the chairs while the music plays!
  - When the music stops, a 'sit down' animation is shown.
  - All players should try to sit on a chair. The player left standing is removed from the game.
  - If there is more than one player still in the game, `-1` is shown to tell you to remove a chair and a flashing arrow points to the touch logo again.
  - When there is only one chair left, the person to sit on it wins (and a smiley face icon is shown).
  
You can set the number of players using the A and B buttons.

You can shake the micro:bit to reset the game back to `4` players.
